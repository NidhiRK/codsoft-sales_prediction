Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning
Task from Codsoft Virtual Internship

As part of the Codsoft Virtual Internship, I worked on a project to predict product sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The task involved using machine learning techniques in Python to build a predictive model and optimize advertising strategies.

Key Steps:
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, which includes advertising spend on TV, Radio, and Newspaper, and sales data.
Model Building: Used Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.
Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
Visualization: Created scatter plots, pair plots, and a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between advertising spend and sales.
Outcome:
This project provided valuable insights into how businesses can optimize their advertising strategies to maximize sales, using machine learning for better decision-making.

Tools Used:

Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
